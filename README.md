# Learning L-systems Revisited
The aim of the collection of programs in this project isn't to demonstrate a program that can learn lindenmayer systems or,
more broadly, context free grammars, but to illuminate some concepts that would be tedious to collect and analyze had it
be done by hand. The program found in error_app/approx.icn is a quick attempt into the problem of guessing the next generation of an l-system.
