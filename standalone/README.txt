Files

*	Most files can be runned independently.

*	gcdTree.icn takes in a sequence a1,a2,...,an such that
	at level i there is ai branches and produces an image
	accordingly

*	lsystem_04.icn draws the lsystem based on rules_system.txt.
	It quits right away so that the "time" function on the linux
	command line can take a recording

*	lsystem_view.icn is the same as lsystem_04.icn but it doesn't
	quit right away and allows the user to view the picture
